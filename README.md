# Ex. No. 6 - SIMULATION OF FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING PROCESS

## DATE: 
## AIM:
### To simulate the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### STEP 1: Click on 'Base'. Base and Build Platform will be displayed on the left side of the screen.
### STEP 2: Click on 'Extruder' then extruder and extruder nozzle will be displayed.
### STEP 3: Click on 'Material Spool' then material spool will be shown.
### STEP 4: Click on 'Filament' then filament will be added.
### STEP 5: Click on 'Start Process' to begin the process.
### STEP 6: After the process is complete click on 'Stop Process' to view product generated using FDM process.
